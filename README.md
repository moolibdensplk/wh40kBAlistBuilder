# wh40kBAlistBuilder

This app will only work on MacOS X
Feel free to fork it and compile for Windows, should compile fine, you will just need to adjust the CMakeLists.txt to compile on Windows.

Currently only supports two factions:
* Space Communist Fish People
* Demonic entities .... (you know... )
if you want to use it  - you might want to ask for the JSON files as I'm not distributing them with the sources.

In order to install the app on MacOS:

* Download the ZIP package from bin/ folder
* Follow the instructions in that package

voila !
